## Sales: Logic for autoSubledger: insert and update
- Client
    - Sends isAutoSubledger field in json
- Server
    - If isAutoSubledger: exec_sql_object_with_auto_subledger
        - exec_sql_object_with_auto_subledger: new method
            - similar to exec_sql_object
                - After handle_auto_ref_no
                    - call new method id = create_auto_subledger: creates new autoSubledger account and gets its id
                    - replace the autoSubledgerId in sqlObject
                    - proceed

## sales: Logic for computation
# onChange fires when data is changed by keyboard
# onValueChange fires when data value itself changes irrespective of what initiated it
# onValueChange is fired first then onChange
# Target is to handle when
    - search is done and priceGst is set by code: setLineItem
    - when any of qty, price, discount, priceGst is changed on keyb
# create following methods
                                                            - computeLineItemValues
                                                                - starting from priceGst calculates subtotal, cgst, sgst, igst, amount and sets those values in form
                                                            - setPrice
                                                                - calculates price from priceGst and other values
                                                                - setValue(price)
                                                            - setPriceGst
                                                                - calculates priceGst from price and other values

# Intended logic for security
‚úÖ 1. Use HTTPS Only
Always serve both frontend and backend over HTTPS to prevent token theft over the network.

Enforce HTTPS with HSTS headers.

‚úÖ 2. Short-Lived Access Tokens + Refresh Tokens
Use short-lived access tokens (e.g., 5‚Äì15 minutes).

Keep a refresh token (longer-lived) in HTTP-only secure cookies.

This limits the damage if an access token is stolen.

‚úÖ 3. Bind Token to Client Fingerprint (Optional)
Attach some client fingerprinting data when issuing the token, such as:

User-Agent string

IP address (if not on mobile networks)

Device ID (if using PWA or native wrappers)
Then, validate these on each request (within reason ‚Äî IP changes on mobile).

But note: this is not foolproof and can cause issues with NAT/shared IPs.

‚úÖ 4. Token Rotation
Rotate access tokens every few minutes.

Detect if a token is reused (e.g., after it's been rotated), and revoke the session.

‚úÖ 5. Add a Custom App Signature Header
To identify your client app (i.e. detect Postman/curl), do the following:

When building your app, include a unique App-Secret string in the code (obfuscate it).

On each request, the client sends a custom header like:

http
Copy
Edit
X-App-Signature: abc123xyz
The server validates this secret.

üîí This is not unbreakable, but raises the bar. Don‚Äôt hardcode obvious secrets.

‚úÖ 6. Content Security Policy (CSP) + CORS
CSP prevents your frontend from being injected with malicious code.

CORS should allow only your frontend origin(s), not *.

‚úÖ 7. Request Rate Limiting / Throttling
Add request throttling on the server per token or IP.

Prevents brute-force abuse of leaked tokens.

‚úÖ 8. Audit Logs + Anomaly Detection
Track:

Which IP used which token

Unexpected request patterns (e.g., batch updates from curl)

Set up alerts for high-risk behavior.

‚úÖ 9. Don't Trust Client-Provided Table/Field Names
‚ö†Ô∏è You mentioned:
"I use JSON to update data which contains table name, field names..."

This is risky. Don‚Äôt allow the client to dynamically control:

table names

field names

SQL fragments

Instead, use internal mapping from validated field names to SQL operations.

‚úÖ 10. Consider GraphQL Persisted Queries (Advanced)
To prevent arbitrary queries/mutations from being sent:

Only allow pre-approved persisted queries (hash-based).

Postman/curl can't forge these easily without access to your frontend build.

‚úÖ 11. Use CSRF Protection for Sensitive Endpoints
Even if you're using access tokens, for cookie-based auth, CSRF tokens are needed.

- Server logic
    - args are %id, %parentId, %accCode, %accName, %accLeaf, %hasParentChanged
    - update AccM set accCode, accName, parentId, accLeaf where id = %accId
    - get parent accType, classId into parentAccType, parentClassId where id = @parentId
    - if %hasParentChanged then
        copy parentAccType, parentclassId to record where id = %accId and all recursive children
- Client logic before submit
    - component is passed parentId, parentAccLeaf, parentAccType, parentClassId, accId, accLeaf, hasChildren, accCode, accName
    - use react-select. OnChange parent get newParentAccLeaf
        if(parentAccLeaf === 'N' && newParentAccLeaf === L)

## Client side side menu
- In SideMenu.tsx find current menuItem from redux selector and get corresponding menu data from master-menu-data.ts
## **Authentication mechanism**
- isLogin is false by default, so login screen is displayed; Otherwise based on type of user, the menu screen will be displayed
- Login screen submit button sends username and password to server /login endpoint
- At fastApi /login endpoint, request is send to **OAuth2PasswordRequestForm** fastapi method; It just provides out username and password as "formdata". The "formdata" is used to create bundle for SuperAdmin(S) or Admin(A) or business user(B). Bundle is sent to client along with accessToken JWT generated
- We do not generate refresh token for simplicity and more security. This will enable frequent login
- Client sets isLogin true and sets accessToken in SignalsStore
- Now due to refresh nature of SignalsStore the menu screen is shown based on logged in user type for SuperAdmin(S), Admin(A), Business user(B)
- At client every request to GraphQL api is secured and accessToken is auto inserted in header as Bearer
- At server whenever a secured request is made authentication of token is required. So every such request is passed through is_valid_token method
- We also create an endpoint verifyToken which uses **OAuth2PasswordBearer** of graphql which plucks out the token from header. This is a shortcut way, otherwise few lines of code will be needed to take out the JWT token. This endpoint is not used for authentication flow but is used to verify a token through fastapi auto generated documentation
- accessToken is segregated and checked. If no token found or token expired then 401 error is sent to client
- When client sees 401 error it sets isLogin to false and logs out. We could have used refreshToken over here to create the new accessToken at server, but at present it is not required
- Now the login screen automatically displays
- We will use localstorage to store the accesstoken. So if the token is not expired then on hard page refresh(F5) the state of software will be maintained
- It is advisable to keep the life of accessToken as 10 hours

## ** Trial balance Sql query** Documentation by AI

Step 1: Recursive Query to Build Account Hierarchy
WITH RECURSIVE hier AS (
    SELECT 
        "accId", 
        "opening", 
        "debit", 
        "credit", 
        "parentId"
    FROM cte1

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        a."id" AS "accId", 
        h."opening", 
        h."debit", 
        h."credit", 
        a."parentId"
    FROM hier h
    JOIN "AccM" a ON h."parentId" = a."id"
),
Purpose: The recursive common table expression (CTE) hier generates a hierarchy of accounts starting from the base data in cte1.
Logic:
The initial anchor query retrieves accounts and their balances.
The recursive part adds parent accounts by joining hier with the AccM table.

Step 2: Constants for Branch and Financial Year
"branchId" AS (VALUES (1::int)), 
"finYearId" AS (VALUES (2024)),

Step 3: Base Data Preparation
cte1 AS (
    SELECT 
        d.id, 
        d."accId", 
        0.00 AS "opening",
        CASE WHEN d."dc" = 'D' THEN d."amount" ELSE 0.00 END AS "debit",
        CASE WHEN d."dc" = 'C' THEN d."amount" ELSE 0.00 END AS "credit",
        a."parentId"
    FROM "TranH" h
    JOIN "TranD" d ON h.id = d."tranHeaderId"
    JOIN "AccM" a ON a.id = d."accId"
    WHERE h."finYearId" = (TABLE "finYearId")
      AND h."branchId" = (TABLE "branchId")

    UNION ALL

    SELECT 
        b.id, 
        b."accId",
        CASE WHEN b."dc" = 'D' THEN b."amount" ELSE -b."amount" END AS "opening",
        0.00 AS "debit",
        0.00 AS "credit",
        a."parentId"
    FROM "AccOpBal" b
    JOIN "AccM" a ON a.id = b."accId"
    WHERE b."finYearId" = (TABLE "finYearId")
      AND b."branchId" = (TABLE "branchId")
),

Step 4: Summarize Data at Each Hierarchical Level
cte2 AS (
    SELECT 
        h."accId", 
        a."accName", 
        a."accCode",

Step 5: Calculate Profit or Loss

Step 6: Final Aggregation and JSON Structure
