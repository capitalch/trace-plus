## Bug fix
																- Super admin clients
																	- New client with ext db. When test connection button is clicked, then client is made inactive from active
## To do
- General
	- Warning: [8840:15064:1215/090856.959:ERROR:CONSOLE(0)] "The source list for Content Security Policy directive 'frame-src' contains a source with an invalid path: '/?ncedge=1&features=-'. The query component, including the '?', will be ignored.", source: about:blank (0)
	- TreeGrid width not properly managed when screen size comes down
	- Provide appropriate logging at server
															- Bottom left User type shows unknown
	- At logout make sure that redux store is initialized by using redux tools
	- Accounts
															- Utils.currentFinYear is misleading. Change it to perhaps nowFinYear
		- When opening balance is not zero show a warning the apening balances do not match
															- In accounts title, right side show client name in dim
- Admin
	- There are some issues related to bu and finyear when a new admin use logs in
	- Provide client name and client code in the email when new Admin user is created in super admin
	- When a new / update BU or Fy then it should be immediately updated to accounts info
	- When admin user logs in: From db get physical BU's and prompt to add if not present
															- Admin, Super admin menu all grids bottom summary rowHeight to be made undefined, so that it becomes proper height summary
															- Show client name in admin screens
															- In Accounts Info modal windows title should be aligned with grid
															- Check why query execution taking longer time. Is is because of external database?
															- Sometimes while switching the client goes in wait mode for ever: Server close connection unexpetdly
- Misc
	- In 2022-23 demo, trial balance op bal show NAN
	- In all grids show a margin of 10 px from bottom
	- Grid fix up sizes for edit, delete and preview buttons
	- Check Capichow bank recon double entry
	- In ledger subledger do a direct search on party name inside subledger
	- Rename globally TraceDataObjectType --> XDetailsType, XDataObjectType --> XDataType
	- rename generic-switch to comp-generic-switch in Master accounts
	- XData showing typescript error in many places. Need to correct the types
	- Drag n drop in Link controls for admin and superadmin does not retain grid expanded status. Also gives error
	- BS, PL, Trial Bal to retain node expanded / collapsed
															- Migrate to tailwind latest version

																							- Verify email from UserM table
																								- If email exists: Send mail with url encoded with email JWT tken for 30 mins
																									- Message: Check you mail for reset link
																								- Else raise error: Email does not exist
																					- Detailed logic
																						- User requests a password reset by entering their email in the frontend.
																						- Frontend sends a request to the backend with the user's email.
																						- Backend validates the email, generates a secure token, and sends an email to the user with a password reset link (containing the token).
																						- User clicks the link and is redirected to a password reset page.
																						- User enters a new password on this page, which is sent to the backend along with the token.
																						- Backend verifies the token, updates the password, and returns a success message.
																					- Ui and client side code
																					- current pwd and pwd cannot be same
																					- Email from server
																					- Login menu
																						- From super admin remove Change password and change uid
																					- Correct some of naming conventions for client and server
																					- Sometimes top navbar menu has different side menu
