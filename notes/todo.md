## Bug fix
	- Accounts
		- Categories: Change parent UI out of place
		- Final reports showing NaN at bottom
		- Home machine accounts master not working
		- Bank recon
			- HDFC bank online
				- balance is not reflecting correctly: running total is wrong
				- 555000 is twice. Many items are twice
	- Admin
		- There are some issues related to bu and finyear when a new admin use logs in
		- Provide client name and client code in the email when new Admin user is created in super admin
		- When a new / update BU or Fy then it should be immediately updated to accounts info
		- When admin user logs in: From db get physical BU's and prompt to add if not present
																- Super admin clients
																	- New client with ext db. When test connection button is clicked, then client is made inactive from active
## To do
														- Old Trace
															- Transfer of closing balance in case of stock journal and branch transfer
															- Update sql of current orders at server
- General
	- TreeGrid width not properly managed when screen size comes down
	- Provide appropriate logging at server											
	- At logout make sure that redux store is initialized by using redux tools											
	- When opening balance is not zero show a warning the apening balances do not match
															- In accounts title, right side show client name in dim
															- Bottom left User type shows unknown
															- Utils.currentFinYear is misleading. Change it to perhaps nowFinYear
														- Admin
	
															- Admin, Super admin menu all grids bottom summary rowHeight to be made undefined, so that it becomes proper height summary
															- Show client name in admin screens
															- In Accounts Info modal windows title should be aligned with grid
															- Check why query execution taking longer time. Is is because of external database?
															- Sometimes while switching the client goes in wait mode for ever: Server close connection unexpetdly
- Misc
	- In 2022-23 demo, trial balance op bal show NAN
	- In all grids show a margin of 10 px from bottom
	- Grid fix up sizes for edit, delete and preview buttons
	- Check Capichow bank recon double entry
	- In ledger subledger do a direct search on party name inside subledger
	- Rename globally TraceDataObjectType --> XDetailsType, XDataObjectType --> XDataType
	- rename generic-switch to comp-generic-switch in Master accounts
	- XData showing typescript error in many places. Need to correct the types
	- Drag n drop in Link controls for admin and superadmin does not retain grid expanded status. Also gives error
	- BS, PL, Trial Bal to retain node expanded / collapsed
	- Product master check duplicate UPC code server side validation
	- current order report: set to place the order to supplier through mail, whatsapp
	- When BU changes, Branches remain of the old BU. So error and system crash
	- Validation for stock Journal: dealerPrice or purPrice for the output product must be there. Don't allow to make purPrice as 0 when the product is in stockJournal output
	- Update function get_stock_on_date in all databases

																						- User requests a password reset by entering their email in the frontend.
																						- Frontend sends a request to the backend with the user's email.
																						- Backend validates the email, generates a secure token, and sends an email to the user with a password reset link (containing the token).
																						- User clicks the link and is redirected to a password reset page.
																						- User enters a new password on this page, which is sent to the backend along with the token.
																						- Backend verifies the token, updates the password, and returns a success message.

																								- GraphQL mutation at server side
																								- Independent Loading indicator
																							- Grid
																								- Create UI for status bar
																								- Status bar align with container
																								- pdf and excel export
	- Search
		- Multiple keyword search
																								- retain searchString in Redux
																								- On Refresh execute the search also
																								- Two buttons
																								- Edit, Delete and Preview
																								- Tooltip widget
																								- load data
																								- last no of rows
																								- Grid instance
																								- Redux with grid
																								- Grid query make work
																								- Columns
																									- client id, clientCode, client name, db name, extdb, active
																								- Error handling
																								- Make use of SqlIds instead of direct id
																								- Aggregates
																								- Refresh icon placement in middle of screen
																								- Data fetch and refetch finalize
																							## GraphQL
																							- store hostUrl in Global context
																							- implement GraphQL with token
## Super Admin
																								- Upgrade the server with latest libs
- Brief learning of GraphQL client and server
- lab
	- Syncfusion grid
	- form validation with ...
	- Data retrieval: React query
	- GraphQL client
	- React query with GraphQL
- implement node.env
- implement react query and graphql in login
- Set graphQL framework at client side and server side

- Super admin UI
	- Dashboard
		- Connections	: Active, Idle, Total
		- Clients		: Active, Inactive, Total
		- Admin users	: Active, Inactive, Total


		- Client details: Grid with columns
			- index, client code, client name, BU's, All users, Roles, Is active
## Bugs
																								- When login the drop down menu is open automatically
																								- Show the user type logged in
## trace-plus
- Server login
																								- Create token
	- Change password
	- Change uid
																								- Top navigation bar
																								- log out
																								- drop down menu
																								- Change uid screen
																								- Change password screen
																								- Side bar
																									- Side menu
																									- Consider highlighting the text instead of background when selecting or hovering a menu item
																									- Not to show Up / Down arrow when there are no children
																									- Provision for color in the masterMenuData
																									- Navigation in children
																									- Navigation in parents when there are no children
		- Transition when drop down in menu items
																									- When no children then parent should be selectable and its color would change
																									- When change menu item in navbar then all parents should be made unexpanded or reset

																									- Check fastAPI error handling. It's not proper at present for superAdmin
																									- SweetAlert2 for error handling
																									- Revisit routing, protected and outlet
## New project with redux-toolkit
																									- Vite setup
