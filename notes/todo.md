															## Final issues as on 08-06-2025
																- Important
																	- ledger show clos balance should be false																									
																	- Drag n drop in Link controls for admin and superadmin does not retain grid expanded status. Also gives error
																		- Link ctrls <-> roles, the roles grid is not auto populated
																	- When bu is changed, sometimes branch is not changed and remains old one
																	- When bu is changed then fin yar id is uncertain
																	- At logout make sure that redux store is initialized by using redux tools
																	- In all grids show a margin of 10 px from bottom
																	- Grid fix up sizes for edit, delete and preview buttons
																	- Strict validation of debits equal credits in Stock Journals
																	- Redux store cleanup at logout has issues. Rework.	
																	- Provide client name and client code in the email when new Admin user is created in super admin
																	- When a new / update BU or Fy then it should be immediately updated to accounts info
																	- Update function get_stock_on_date in all databases
																	- When admin user logs in: From db get physical BU's and prompt to add if not present
																		- Link button
																	- Product master check duplicate UPC code server side validation

- Nice to have
	- current order report: set to place the order to supplier through mail, whatsapp
	- BS, PL, Trial Bal to retain node expanded / collapsed
	- Each branch can have separate address. If branch address not present, take address of unit
	- Provide appropriate logging at server
	- Check  at large data the grid with template columns become slow
	- Avoid keeping large data in redux in many places. Use page level state i.e useState for that

															- Admin, Super admin menu all grids bottom summary rowHeight to be made undefined, so that it becomes proper height summary
															- Show client name in admin screens

																				- While login get roleId and roleName also as loginInfo
																- validations
																	- Test case
																		- Create a new business user with client_id 51
																		- Try to change its uid to capital
																			- there should server validation error
																		- Try to change its uid to capital1
																			- it should be OK
																			- Admin users
																				- Business users: Server side validations
																					- While create / edit email check that same clientID + email is unique
																					- Make use of coalesce for edit
																				- Change uid
																					- make sure that new clientID + uid is unique
																					- use coalesce for edit

																				- Display user email on screen after login
																				- Apply client side validations prior to server side validations in Super admin
																					- handle clientid axios error in login screen when server is not running
																				- Change uid
																					- Ui
																					- current uid and uid cannot be same
																					- verify current UID at server
																					- Email from server
																				- Change pwd
																					- Logic
																						- UI Forgot password popup with email input
																						- Hits at unsecured url forgot-password
																							- Verify email from UserM table
																								- If email exists: Send mail with url encoded with email JWT tken for 30 mins
																									- Message: Check you mail for reset link
																								- Else raise error: Email does not exist
																					- Detailed logic
																						- User requests a password reset by entering their email in the frontend.
																						- Frontend sends a request to the backend with the user's email.
																						- Backend validates the email, generates a secure token, and sends an email to the user with a password reset link (containing the token).
																						- User clicks the link and is redirected to a password reset page.
																						- User enters a new password on this page, which is sent to the backend along with the token.
																						- Backend verifies the token, updates the password, and returns a success message.
																					- Ui and client side code
																					- current pwd and pwd cannot be same
																					- Email from server
																					- Login menu
																						- From super admin remove Change password and change uid
																					- Correct some of naming conventions for client and server
																					- Sometimes top navbar menu has different side menu
																					- When top menu changes then do clean up and make the screen blank
