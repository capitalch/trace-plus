- There is a project in this folder developed in React+Vite+Typescript+tailwindcss.
- Find the folder C:\projects\trace-plus\dev\trace-client-lab\src\features\accounts\purchase-sales\sales\all-sales
- Find the React component all-sales.tsx. This uses another react component sales-form2.tsx
- You have to only work in file sales-form2.tsx. There are different sections in this file named as "Invoice Details", "Customer Details", "Items & Services", "Payment Details", "Validation", "Shipping"
- Without changing ui/ux of sales-form2.tsx you need to break all the sections in independent React Components. Name the React components accordingly. Put each created react component in individual folder
- Finally assemble all created react components to a new react component called FinalSalesForm and place it in all-sales.tsx at appropriate place
