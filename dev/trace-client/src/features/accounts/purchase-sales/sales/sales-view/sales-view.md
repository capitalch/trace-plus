    - Create a component named as AllSalesVew in all-sales-view.tsx file in folder sales-view
        - AllSalesView will be on same pattern as of all-purchases-view.tsx
    - When in StatusBar of default screen, View button is clicked:
        - AllSalesForm component is replaced by AllSalesView on the screen
        - In AllSalesView there is a nice prominent back button to go back to previous display consisting of AllSalesForm component
