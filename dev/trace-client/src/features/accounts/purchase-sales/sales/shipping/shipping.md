- Instructions to modify shipping-edit-modal.tsx
    - transfer two props from parent
        - shippingData of type ShippingInfoType and setParentValue which is setValue of parent component Shipping
    - Create new form by using useForm<ShippingInfoType>. form default value is shippingData
    - UI of the current form remains unchanged
    - Follow the pattern and practise as in customer-new-edit-modal.tsx
    - OnSubmit copies form value to shippingInfo of parent form using setParentValue
    - cancel and close closes the form without any changes to parent form
    - Rest does the reset of current form
    - clean up unnecessary items
