# Strange situation
- In general_ledger_page an account is selected in modal
- When in web application with production url https://pilotcloudjiffy.net, ledger of selected accounts is properly displayed
- When an apk is created and deployed in physical device everything is working. But when an account is selected for ledger output, the screen shows never ending busy indicator. No accounts ledger is visible. Only busy indicator for ever.
